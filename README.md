A lightweight and modular backend template built with [Nitro](https://nitro.build/), designed to accelerate the development of secure and scalable APIs. This starter kit integrates essential features like JWT authentication, encryption, and database connectivity, making it an ideal foundation for modern web applications.

## Features

* **Nitro-Powered**: Utilizes Nitro, a next-generation server toolkit, for rapid development and deployment.
* **JWT Authentication**: Implements JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure user authentication.
* **Encryption**: Includes built-in mechanisms for data encryption to enhance security.
* **Database Integration**: Pre-configured to connect with databases, facilitating data management.
* **Modular Structure**: Organized codebase promoting scalability and maintainability.

## Getting Started
